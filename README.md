# Tetris_RL

## creating Tetris
- [x] create bored
- [X] generate random Tet 
- [X] implment scoring and levels 
- [X] finish coords for all tets
- [X] movement methods
### Test by making a default choice depending on what Tet is currently avialable 
- [X] compleated

## Getting Game states from bored 
- [ ] get max height
- [ ] get mind height
- [ ] Get score 
- [ ] het bumpyness 
- [X] get game states to return
this might not be nessary, instead a bitmap of the board will be outputted as long as the score 

### Test by making a a formula that based on hurtisics and Tet a certain rotation and line is chosen
- [X] compleated

## RL model
- [X] create state action que
- [X] implement greedy epsilon stratagy
- [X] start on CNN
impliment CNN to analyse numpy array of board
